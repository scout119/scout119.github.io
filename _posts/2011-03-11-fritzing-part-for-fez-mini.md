When I was learning about Arduino, I always liked images that show how to connect different components to Arduino board. Like the one below:

I didn't know how these images are created until I have discovered [Fritzing](http://www.fritzing.org/). "Fritzing is an open-source initiative to support designers, artists, researchers and hobbyists to work creatively with interactive electronics."

Fritzing comes with hundreds of components and it allows you to create your own parts.

I am using FEZ boards a lot lately, and I want to have a Fritzing part for FEZ boards. Since I couldn't find any I have decided to make these parts. Here is my first completed part for [FEZ Mini](http://www.ghielectronics.com/catalog/product/134):

Stay tuned for other FEZ parts. FEZ Panda is next!
