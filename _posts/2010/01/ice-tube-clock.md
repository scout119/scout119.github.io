January 30 was not a usual winter day for Chesapeake, VA.

I have been here for more than 5 years and I don't remember seeing so much snow that actually stays on the ground. So I have decided to finish Ice Tube Clock. I have bought 5 pcb boards from [Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=39&amp;products_id=195) site. They sell [full kit](http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=39&amp;products_id=194) as well. The rest of components I got from various sources and the tube itself is from eBay.

I don't have access to a laser cutter so I have used my Dremel scroll saw to cut the case. Here is the finished product:

[Chris](http://www.threadabort.com/) came up with the idea of displaying temperature in addition to time using wireless temperature sensor. We are going to try it when we have more free time.
