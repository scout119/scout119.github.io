Great news! I just got Welcome email from MAKE. I got accepted to the MAKE Beta Team! A number of makers around the world has been selected to beta-build some projects that might get into the MAKE Magazine.

I am very excited about it and looking forward to build my first project. Looks like we might start for the fall issue No. 32. Thank you MAKE!
