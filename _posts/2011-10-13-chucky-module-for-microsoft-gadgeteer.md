This is my third module so far. It is the simplest one. It has no components beside the connector.

With the soldered connector

Nunchuk fits perfectly and securely

I am also experimenting with Google SketchUp and EagleUp. Here is the result

Gus Issa from GHI Electornics has suggested to make a video of all three modules in action. I will try to do that sometime and will make a post about it.

This module is available for sale. Information on how to order is on TinyCLR [Community modules page](https://wiki.tinyclr.com/index.php?title=Community_Offers#Chucky_Module_v1.0).
