I have been supporting some project on [KickStarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) recently and I would like to mention some of these projects on this blog.

First one that I am excited to get my hands on is CoAction Hero board:

This is a very nice little board. Here is some of the technical details:

- LPC1759 ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller
- 512KB Flash Memory
- 64KB RAM
- 120MHz Clock
- 1MB Flash with filesystem

One of the coolest features about this board is that it comes with preinstalled real-time embedded operating system - CoActionOS.
The project is very close to be successfully funded with two more week left till the deadline. Tyler Gilbert the creator of the CoAction Hero has been doing great job with the updates and already posted some really nice demos.
If you haven't seen it yet check it out on KS - [CoAction Hero: 32-bit Open-Source ARM Cortex-M3 Board](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/966383008/coaction-hero-32-bit-open-source-arm-cortex-m3-boa)
