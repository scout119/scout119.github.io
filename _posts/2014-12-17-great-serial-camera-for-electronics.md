I have a project in mind for a long time now. To make a time lapse video of tree in my backyard. I cut it branches (6-8' each) in the spring and by the end of the summer it grows it back. It is amazing. Was not sure what camera to use for that project. I think I have found it now on Kick Starter. ALCAM camera made by [GHI Electronics](https://www.ghielectronics.com/). Here is the specification:

- Still Image plus Stop Motion and Time-Lapse Videos.
- Resolutions: HD 720, 1024x768, 800x600, 640x480, 320x240, 160x120.
- Serial interfaces: I2C, UART and SPI.
- MicroSD Card with SD signals exposed for optional full SD Card.
- Configuration settings available for: brightness, contrast, white balance, special effects, sharpness, saturation, mirror, rotate.
- Simple human-readable command protocol.
- OV3640 3MP Image Sensor (with beta support for 5MP and 2MP).
- Works great with mbed, Arduino, NETMF and any other platform supporting a micro with I2C, UART or SPI interface.
- Real documentation and support.
- Light weight at only .20 oz making it perfect for drones, quads and robots.
- Dimensions : 30.6 x 47.05 x 9.9 mm (includes camera height).
- On board 3.3V regulator, works with any voltage 4.5V to 6V.
- 180mA fully active plus SD card, with planned low power modes.
- 5V tolerant IOs. Meaning you can directly connect a 5V micro, like an Arduino.
