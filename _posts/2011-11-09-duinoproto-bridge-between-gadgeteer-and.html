<br />I am a big fun of the Microsoft Gadgeteer (if you have not figure it out by now :) ). Right now there is pretty much only one company in the US that is actively developing Gadgeteer modules and boards - <a href="http://www.ghielectronics.com/catalog/category/265/">GHI Electronics</a>. So I follow that company very closely. Today they put up another Gadgeteer related product - <a href="http://www.ghielectronics.com/catalog/product/319">DuinoProto</a>. It is not a Gadgeteer module (it doesn't follow the standard), &nbsp;but rather a solution that should help prototyping modules much easier and also should bridge the gap between Gadgeteer and&nbsp;existing&nbsp;shields and modules for Arduino(s). There are <a href="http://wiki.tinyclr.com/index.php?title=DuinoProto">other&nbsp;scenarios</a>&nbsp;of using it&nbsp;as well.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IEIuNi2JW28/TrsXRvGXcBI/AAAAAAAAAPk/MvHsLmDiE8c/s1600/DuinoProto.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="564" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IEIuNi2JW28/TrsXRvGXcBI/AAAAAAAAAPk/MvHsLmDiE8c/s640/DuinoProto.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />As you can see it has an Arduino shield form factor. There is also a nice prototyping area and a place to put up to four Gadgeteer socket connectors. I am definitely going to try it as soon as I have more time and get my hands on one of these.<br /><br />Oh, &nbsp;did I mention that you can get one for free (some conditions apply)?! &nbsp;<a href="http://www.tinyclr.com/contest/">Here you go</a>!
