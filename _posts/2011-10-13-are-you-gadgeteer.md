[Are you a Gadgeteer?](https://devhammer.net/blog/are-you-a-gadgeteer#.TpbrSqJGA0Y.blogger) posted a nice unboxing video of the [FEZ Spider Starter Kit](https://www.ghielectronics.com/catalog/product/297),which I own as well. Although mine didn't come in a nice plastic box, but I was one of the first 5 to get it a month earlier of the official shipping date.
