This is a proof of concept for Arduino based Gadgeteer DaisyLink module.The Gadgeteer DaisyLink protocol allows to chain up to 126 various modules on one socket. The protocol is based on I2C-based EEPROM interface.

In this picture I have two modules chained on one socket. The first module is GHI's multicolor led, the second is Arduino led module. More details later...
