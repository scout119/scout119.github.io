There were some talks on the [community forum pages](https://www.ghielectronics.com/community) about this device for awhile. I have been waiting for it with a great anticipation. Finally, a week ago we got the official [announcement](https://www.ghielectronics.com/community/forum/topic?id=12661).

Not only that, but GHI Electronics is also running a [KickStarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1359959821/open-source-programmable-hand-held-console) where they offer KS only limited editions of the console. The official version is a white colored console. You can get black and/or pink through KickStarter.

This is a very neat little device. Here is the specification:

- Cortex-M4 168Mhz microprocessor
- 1024KB FLASH
- 192KB RAM
- 320 x 240 16-bit TFT display
- 3D Accelerometer
- Speaker
- Volume control
- USB Connection (for loading and debugging applications)
- Bluetooth option
- JTAG/SWD (for advanced users)
- Runs off 3xAAA batteries

If you are a Gadgeteer fun you will be glad to know that device has 3 Gadgeteer sockets inside the case.

On the image above you can also see the optional Bluetooth module soldered to the main PCB.

The remaining two sockets are on the other side of the board:

Socket number 3 is Z type socket (manufacturer specific). This is the socket you will need to use if you want to explore JTAG/SWD item (for advanced users) from the specification above. The first two sockets combined provide connectivity with Gadgeteer modules that require P,S,U,A,O, or Y sockets. That is a very rich list of modules. You can turn this little device into a very useful gadget using one of [these modules](https://www.ghielectronics.com/catalog/category/275).

I am very excited to get my hands on the console. This is great educational device. I am looking forward to play with it with my son. He has been asking me lately to teach him programming. This device is perfect for that. Great offer GHI!
