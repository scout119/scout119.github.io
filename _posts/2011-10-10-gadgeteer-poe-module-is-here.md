I have designed POE Module for [Microsoft Gadgeteer](https://www.netmf.com/gadgeteer/). I received pcb boards last week from [DorkbotPDX](https://www.dorkbotpdx.org/wiki/pcb_order) (awesome service by the way). The boards are of a great quality and look very nice.

The only issue is that this board has to be red, because it is a power module, but DorkbotPDX only offer purple boards for now. So if the module is offered to the public it has to be red (according with specification). Here is another picture of two modules side by side. As you can see module on the right is populated with all components.
