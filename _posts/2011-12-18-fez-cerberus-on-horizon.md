Some information started to show up on the [forum](https://www.tinyclr.com/forum/21/5133/). It is about a new mysterious (well, not as mysterious now) offer from [GHI Electronics](https://www.ghielectronics.com/) - FEZ Cerberus. For now there is only this image available:

It looks like GHI is very serious about supporting Gadgeteer and I am sure this new main board will be as great as the other two.
