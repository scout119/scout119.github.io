Tonight I have tested the module. The test application gets [rss feed](https://www.ghielectronics.com/rss/) and shows first 4 entries on the display module. Everything worked as it should.

The module is compatible with [GHI's Ethernet J11D Module](https://www.ghielectronics.com/catalog/product/284). So I did not write module's driver for testing. I still have to do that, so it will be properly used in the Visual Studio Designer.

Once this is done I will upload everything to the [Gadgeteer Codeplex](https://gadgeteer.codeplex.com/).
