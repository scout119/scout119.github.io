I am a big fun of the Microsoft Gadgeteer (if you have not figure it out by now :) ). Right now there is pretty much only one company in the US that is actively developing Gadgeteer modules and boards - [GHI Electronics](https://www.ghielectronics.com/catalog/category/265/). So I follow that company very closely. Today they put up another Gadgeteer related product - [DuinoProto](https://www.ghielectronics.com/catalog/product/319). It is not a Gadgeteer module (it doesn't follow the standard), but rather a solution that should help prototyping modules much easier and also should bridge the gap between Gadgeteer and existing shields and modules for Arduino(s). There are [other scenarios](https://wiki.tinyclr.com/index.php?title=DuinoProto) for using it as well.

As you can see it has an Arduino shield form factor. There is also a nice prototyping area and a place to put up to four Gadgeteer socket connectors. I am definitely going to try it as soon as I have more time and get my hands on one of these.

Oh, did I mention that you can get one for free (some conditions apply)?! [Here you go](https://www.tinyclr.com/contest/)!
